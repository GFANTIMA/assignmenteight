  <p class="lead caption">Hundreds of others were injured in the 7.4-magnitude tremor off the island’s east coast, which was felt across the region and prompted tsunami warnings that were later lifted.</p>
<h1>Taiwan's strongest earthquake in 25 years kills at least 9 </h1>
<h2>Rescue attempts were made to try and save 71 trapped workers </h2>

<p>Rescue efforts were underway to free 71 workers trapped in two rock quarries in the hardest-hit Hualien region, the NFA said. There were also reports that multiple people were trapped in eight collapsed tunnels in and around Hualien City, about 70 miles southeast of the Taiwanese capital Taipei.</p>

<p>The 7.4 magnitude quake happened around 8 a.m. local time (8 p.m. Tuesday ET) at a depth of about 21 miles, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The epicenter was about 11 miles south-southwest of Hualien City, on the island’s Pacific coast.</p>

<p>It was the strongest earthquake to hit Taiwan since 1999, when a 7.6 magnitude tremor killed about 2,400 people, said Wu Chien-fu, director of Taiwan’s Seismological Center.</p>

<p>While 1,011 people have so far been reported injured, Taiwanese fire officials warned that that figure — along with the death toll — could rise in the coming days.</p>

<p>The authorities have still not been able to reach at least 50 people who were riding in mini-buses through Taroko National Park when the quake struck and knocked out local phone networks.</p>

<p>Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said a disaster response center had been set up and that the National Army would provide support to local governments. She also warned her constituents to be wary of aftershocks.</p>

<p>Annie Lima, an American who has lived in Taiwan for almost 17 years, was visiting friends in Hualien on Tuesday when the building they were in began to tremble. She said there continued to be aftershocks in the afternoon, hours after the initial quake.</p>

<p>When the shaking started, Lima said she and her husband ran for the nearest doorway.</p>

<p>Videos on social media showed two buildings in Hualien, one nine stories tall and the other five stories tall, that appeared to be partially pancaked and twisted into odd angles.</p>

<p>Delickta said he and other local business operators had been expecting an influx of visitors this weekend. It's the start of a traditional Chinese festival known as Tomb-Sweeping Day, when people honor their ancestors. But the rail service has been disrupted by the earthquake.</p>

<p>The earthquake was also felt in all parts of Taiwan, the Central News Agency reported. Metro systems in Taipei, the capital, as well as the cities of Taichung and Kaohsiung, were suspended before mostly resuming, the agency said.</p>
